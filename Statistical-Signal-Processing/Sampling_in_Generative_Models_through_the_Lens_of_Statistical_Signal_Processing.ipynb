        "## Core Statement\n",
        "\n",
        "Sampling in generative models is the act of generating new data by drawing realizations from a **learned stochastic representation** of a signal. This is fully consistent with the principles of **Statistical Signal Processing (SSP)**. Sampling is not copying data; it is probabilistic generation from an inferred data-generating process.\n",

        "\n",
        "In SSP, a signal is not treated as a fixed object but as a **random variable or random process**. Observed data are realizations drawn from an underlying probability distribution:\n",

        "- inferring hidden or latent structure,\n",
        "- reconstructing or generating plausible realizations of the signal.\n",
